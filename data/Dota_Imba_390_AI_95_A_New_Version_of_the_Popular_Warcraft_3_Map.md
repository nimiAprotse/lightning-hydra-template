The latest version of Dota Imba is 3.90 AI 95, which was released in April 2023 by Mimya, the current maintainer of the map. This version introduces several new features and improvements, such as:
 
- A new hero: Arc Warden, the Fractal Guardian. He can create a copy of himself that can use all his abilities and items, making him a versatile and powerful hero.
- A new item: Aghanim's Shard, which can be purchased for 1400 gold and grants a special upgrade to one of the hero's abilities. Each hero has a different upgrade, some of which are exclusive to Dota Imba.
- A new mode: Overthrow, which is a fast-paced and chaotic game mode where teams compete to kill each other and collect coins that spawn around the map. The team with the most coins at the end of the match wins.
- Many balance changes and bug fixes to heroes, items and abilities.

Dota Imba 3.90 AI 95 also features an improved AI system that can play most of the heroes and modes in the map. The AI can be customized by changing its difficulty level, behavior and strategy. The AI can also cooperate with human players or play against them.
